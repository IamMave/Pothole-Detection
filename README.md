# Android applicaton for detection of Potholes

This application will help to determine the presence of Potholes on a road. The idea is to build an
application using android smartphones which are pre equipped with gyroscopic, accelerometer and GPS
sensors that can be programmed to detect real world physical changes made by the
smartphone device.


# How to use

Step 4:
You can contribute your coordinates to every other users by hitting the 'Sync' button.

This idea can be extended to detect humps and other irregularities on roads.
